**(1) UCI EEG Database - http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/EEG+Database**

**Data set information**:

  * It contains measurements from 64 electrodes placed on subject's scalps which were sampled at 256 Hz (3.9-msec epoch) for 1 second.
  * There were two groups of subjects: alcoholic and control.
  * Each subject was exposed to either a single stimulus (S1) or to two stimuli (S1 and S2) which were pictures of objects chosen from the 1980 Snodgrass and Vanderwart picture set. When two stimuli were shown, they were presented in either a matched condition where S1 was identical to S2 or in a non-matched condition where S1 differed from S2.
  * There were 122 subjects and each subject completed 120 trials where different stimuli were shown.

**Channels**:
  * as described in the image from the Download page (https://code.google.com/p/icaeeg/downloads/list).

**Notes**:

  * Unknown: interval between stimuli and duration of stimuli for the first paradigm (with a single stimulus)

**Possible limitation**: missing data / only data epoch is available (between 0 and 1 s after stimulus presentation)

**(2) SCCN data - http://sccn.ucsd.edu/~arno/fam2data/publicly_available_EEG_data.html**

Dataset similar with the previous one, but includes continuous data.

**Data set information**:
  * 32-channel data, acquired using the Neuroscan software
  * total: 14 subjects (7 males, 7 females)
  * Subjects are performing a go-nogo categorization task and a go-no recognition task on natural photographs presented very briefly (20 ms - 2 frames of a 100 Hz SVGA screen). Each subject responded to a total of 2500 trials.
  * data is CZ referenced and is sampled at 1000 Hz (corresponding to a sample bin of 1 ms)

**Notes**:
  * Interested only in the animal categorization task. Participants had to respond whenever there was an animal in the picture.
  * Both tasks (categorization and recognition) were organized in series of 100 images; 50 targets images were mixed with 50 non-targets in the animal categorization task.
  * 25 groups of file, each group of file corresponding to 100 trials (13 group of file for session of day 1 and 12 groups of file for session of day 2), were recorded for each subject.
  * Each base file name corresponds to the presentation of 100 images (50 targets and 50 distractors) and has a .CNT file generated by the Neuroscan software that contains RAW continuous data and simple events indicating the time of presentation of stimuli.
  * Base file names for categorization task:
    * xxx1ff01, xxx1ff04, xxx1ff07, xxx1ff10, xxx1ff13, xxx2ff01, xxx2ff04, xxx2ff07, xxx2ff10, xxx2ff12 ("xxx" indicates the initials of each subject)
  * a color photograph was flashed for 20 ms; participants were given 1000 ms to respond; the stimulus onset asynchrony (SOA) was 2000 ms plus or minus a random delay of 200 ms.

**Channels**:
  * names in the 10-20 system: FP1, FP2, F3, F4, C3, C4, P3, P4, O1, O2, F7, F8, T7, T8, P7, P8, Fz, Pz, TP7, TP8, PO7, PO8, PO3, PO4, POz, Oz, Iz, O9, O10, PO9, PO10

**Potential problem**:
  * very large dataset

**->** [ftp://www.sccn.ucsd.edu/pub/eeglab_data.set](ftp://www.sccn.ucsd.edu/pub/eeglab_data.set)
  * Two types of events recorded: 'square' and 'rt'.
    * 'square' events correspond to the appearance of a green colored square on the display
    * 'rt' events correspond to the reaction time of the subject
  * Subjects were to ignore circles presented. Data contains only target stimuli, i.e. 'square'
  * **'Faked'** continuous data (the EEG dataset was actually constructed by concatenating eighty separate three-second data epochs)
