**June 1st**

  * Searched for suitable EEG datasets
  * Looked over the existing code for the fMRI project and experimented with the dataset (made a movie with fMRI data during visual stimulation: http://code.google.com/p/icaeeg/wiki/fMRI_Video)

**June 2nd**

  * Extended the previously made movie with the data obtained from the fMRI ICA MCMC project (http://code.google.com/p/icaeeg/wiki/fMRI_Video)

**June 3rd**

  * Searched for a suitable EEG dataset and started experimenting with one (http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/EEG+Database http://code.google.com/p/icaeeg/downloads/list)
  * Figure out the standard position of the electrodes placed on a subject's scalp during EEG (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/10-20_system_(EEG))

**June 4th**

  * Match the locations of the electrodes with the data.
  * Experimented with the EEG data from the UCI database and produced a video (http://code.google.com/p/icaeeg/wiki/EEG_Video)
  * Selected a new dataset to work on (http://sccn.ucsd.edu/~arno/fam2data/publicly_available_EEG_data.html) because the previous dataset (from UCI database) had missing data (was not continuous).

**June 7th**

  * Studied the dataset from http://sccn.ucsd.edu/~arno/fam2data/publicly_available_EEG_data.html
  * Used EEGLAB on the .CNT files from the dataset, and created a script that uses EEGLAB to extract the needed data from the .CNT files, and produce a .MAT file containing the data from the 31 electrodes and the series of events (stimuli).
  * Created a simple video for one of the trials in the dataset.

**June 9th**

  * Extracted a slice of data with 3 events from the entire data recorded for one patient in a series, and made a movie (incl. the reference function) on that smaller dataset. Still quite a lot of data (~7000 frames to describe the values during 3 events).

**June 11th**

  * Updated the database wiki page and found another dataset (SCCN5box).
  * Played with EEGLAB.

**June 13th**
  * Applied ICA MCMC on EEG datasets (UCI and SCCN5box).
  * Created an outline for the final report.

**June 14th**
  * Uploaded ICA MCMC results (scalp topographies) and Matlab source code.
  * Second planning meeting.
  * Created page for the project report (http://code.google.com/p/icaeeg/wiki/Project_Report)
  * Started writing the report.

**June 15th**
  * Report-related activities.

**June 16th**
  * Writing the report.

**June 17th**
  * Experimenting with the datasets, collecting results.
  * Writing the report.

**June 18th**
  * Finished writing the first draft for the paper (report).

**June 22st**
  * Writing the paper.

**June 23rd**
  * Writing the paper (formatting and supplementary content).
  * Uploaded final paper.
